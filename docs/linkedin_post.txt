SDL Multi-Agent Security Squad: STRIDE + DAST + CI/CD gates live. 🚀

I just shipped an SDL Multi-Agent Security Squad that orchestrates SAST, DAST, SCA, and SDL phase gates in one pipeline.

What’s included:
✅ STRIDE threat modeling + DREAD risk scoring
✅ SAST scans (Semgrep/Bandit)
✅ DAST simulation + fuzzing checks
✅ SCA dependency CVE checks
✅ SDL phase gates (A1–A5) + Security Champion checklists
✅ BSIMM maturity dashboard

Why it matters:
- Faster threat detection earlier in the SDLC
- Clear risk prioritization with DREAD
- Automated gating for CI/CD security compliance

Next: live Streamlit demo + public benchmarks.
